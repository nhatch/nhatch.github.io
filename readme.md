## Research Interests

I am interested in machine learning, somewhere in the middle of the theory-application spectrum. Recently I have been studying continuous-control reinforcement learning for robotics under the direction of [Byron Boots](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bboots3/).

## Publications

[Group Theory: An Introduction and an Application](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/VIGRE/VIGRE2011/REUPapers/Hatch.pdf). University of Chicago VIGRE REU, 2011.

## Bio

I began studying in the Georgia Tech [Machine Learning PhD program](http://ml.gatech.edu/phd) in Fall 2017. Prior to that, I worked for three years as a software engineer at [eSpark Learning](http://www.esparklearning.com), a young education technology company working on improving academic results for grade school students by curating educational resources based on test scores. I completed my Bachelor of Science degree at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu) in 2014 with a double major in mathematics and computer science.
