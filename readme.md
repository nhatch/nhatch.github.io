## Research Interests

I'm interested in hierarchical policies for reinforcement learning (RL). For example, robotic navigation is generally solved hierarchically via planning (solving a simplified problem to choose a path) and control (following that path using a more detailed model). This seems to be more computation- and sample-efficient than directly applying standard RL algorithms. Recently, I've been investigating this question in the context of robotic navigation by interpreting the planning solution as an approximate value function for the RL problem.
Before that, I did some work in learning a real-time, dynamic
[bipedal locomotion](https://youtu.be/daH26hxTfsg) controller for rough terrain.

On the hardware side, I've been closely involved with developing perception/planning/control algorithms for the [Clearpath Warthog autonomous ground vehicle](https://photos.app.goo.gl/uXSBswH8FgHnaorr5) at UW.
I've also been participating in a student club, [Husky Robotics](https://www.huskyrobotics.me/), that designs and builds Mars rovers to participate in the University Rover Challenge.

My advisor is [Dr. Byron Boots](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bboots/), who
directs the University of Washington [Robot Learning Lab](http://robotlearning.gatech.edu).

## Bio

I joined the University of Washington [CS PhD program](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd) in Winter 2020, after two and a half years in the Georgia Tech [ML PhD program](http://ml.gatech.edu/phd). Prior to that, I worked for three years as a software engineer at [eSpark Learning](http://www.esparklearning.com), an education technology company that adaptively curates educational resources for grade school students based on their test scores. I completed my Bachelor of Science degree at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu) in 2014 with a double major in mathematics and computer science.
