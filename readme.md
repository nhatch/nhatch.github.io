## Research Interests

I'm interested in developing and analyzing algorithms for reinforcement learning
problems, especially in cases where the environment is complicated but there is a "teacher"
available. For example, this teacher could be an oracle mapping states to actions (imitation
learning) or it could be some additional structure in the learning process (curriculum
learning). I hope to find some interesting theory and test it on real-world RL problems like
robotic control. My advisor is [Dr. Byron Boots](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bboots3/), who
directs the [Georgia Tech Robot Learning Lab](http://robotlearning.gatech.edu).

## Bio

I began studying in the Georgia Tech [Machine Learning PhD program](http://ml.gatech.edu/phd) in Fall 2017. Prior to that, I worked for three years as a software engineer at [eSpark Learning](http://www.esparklearning.com), an education technology company that adaptively curates educational resources for grade school students based on their test scores. I completed my Bachelor of Science degree at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu) in 2014 with a double major in mathematics and computer science.
