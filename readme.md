## Research Interests

I am interested in machine learning, somewhere in the middle of the theory-application spectrum. Recent topics include transfer learning, meta learning, and hierarchical reinforcement learning. My advisor is [Dr. Byron Boots](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bboots3/), who directs the [Robot Learning Lab](http://robotlearning.gatech.edu).

## Bio

I began studying in the Georgia Tech [Machine Learning PhD program](http://ml.gatech.edu/phd) in Fall 2017. Prior to that, I worked for three years as a software engineer at [eSpark Learning](http://www.esparklearning.com), an education technology company that adaptively curates educational resources for grade school students based on their test scores. I completed my Bachelor of Science degree at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu) in 2014 with a double major in mathematics and computer science.
