## Research Interests

I'm interested in machine learning for robotic perception and control, with a focus on potential applications in autonomous vehicles.
My recent work focuses on high-speed
[obstacle avoidance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o2xyIGSVTon7gWzoNC7yMmsSjr-Kxasw/view?usp=drivesdk)
using [information theoretic model-predictive control](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02342).
Before that, I did some work in learning a real-time, dynamic
[bipedal locomotion](https://youtu.be/daH26hxTfsg) controller for rough terrain.
My advisor is [Dr. Byron Boots](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bboots/), who
directs the University of Washington [Robot Learning Lab](http://robotlearning.gatech.edu).

## Bio

I joined the University of Washington [CS PhD program](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd) in Winter 2020, after two and a half years in the Georgia Tech [ML PhD program](http://ml.gatech.edu/phd). Prior to that, I worked for three years as a software engineer at [eSpark Learning](http://www.esparklearning.com), an education technology company that adaptively curates educational resources for grade school students based on their test scores. I completed my Bachelor of Science degree at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu) in 2014 with a double major in mathematics and computer science.
