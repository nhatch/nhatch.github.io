ROBOTIC SYSTEMS ENGINEERING EXPERIENCE
======================================

RACER Project, U. of Washington
Software Team Lead
Seattle, WA
September 2021 - present
Develop perception, planning, and control software for ~10 m/s autonomous navigation of a Polaris RZR in off-road terrain including dirt trails, steep hills, tall grass, bushes, trees, water, and rocks

Brainstorm and prioritize big projects that might improve autonomous performance (e.g. variable dt)
Design and implement features for local planning and control (e.g. attitude costs)
Design and implement tools for efficient development and field tests (e.g. testing on rosbag replay)
Curate regression test cases and tune parameters to pass the tests
Prepare software for weekly field tests (code review, simulation validation, writing field test plan)
Attend field tests, direct experiments, drive chase vehicle, and assist with recovery after accidents
Analyze field test results to identify issues and propose solutions (e.g. open-loop execution at waypoints)
Manage 10-person team (maintain task tracking system, weekly group meeting, and several 1-1s)
Recruit and interview team members and maintain onboarding materials
Explain technical progress to stakeholders, including UW PIs and DARPA program manager
Handle software-related logistics (e.g. data offload, security, shipping computing equipment)

SARA Project, U. of Washington
System Engineer
Seattle, WA
June 2019 - September 2021

Conducted weekly field experiments for perception, planning, and control of a Clearpath Warthog robot
(a.k.a. Argo J5 XTR) outfitted with cameras and an Ouster OS2 LIDAR sensor
Handled physical and electrical hardware integration for new sensors
Sped up the LIDAR processing pipeline to 10Hz to support 3m/s vehicle velocities

Husky Robotics Club, U. of Washington
Software Subsystem Lead
Seattle, WA
January 2020 - September 2021

Wrote software for teleoperation and autonomous control of a student-designed and -built Mars rover
Recruited team members and delegated tasks to prepare for the University Rover Challenge (URC)
Implemented a planar navigation simulator with A* search, and inverse kinematics for the rover arm
Teleoperated the rover during the 2021 virtual URC, in which we placed 3rd globally!
